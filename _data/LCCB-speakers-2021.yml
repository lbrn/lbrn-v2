    Moriah Szpara is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Biology, and of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the Pennsylvania State University. Her group is part of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics (CIDD) at Penn State, within the Huck Institutes for the Life Sciences. Szpara received her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cell Biology from the University of California Berkeley, in neurobiology. As a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University with Dr. Lynn Enquist, Dr. Szpara focused on the neurotropic herpesviruses. The Szpara lab now explores the impacts of viral genetic diversity on virulence and disease severity, with a focus on viruses that infect the nervous system. This research spans the range from genomic and bioinformatic comparisons of viral genomes, to dissecting viral interactions with human neurons, to examining viral diversity in real-world human infections. We also build open-source tools for working with viral genomes, like VirAmp <a href="http://viramp.com">(http://viramp.com)</a> and VirGA <a href="http://virga.readthedocs.org/">(http://virga.readthedocs.org/)</a>. You can keep up with the lab’s research at: <a href="http://szparalab.psu.edu/">http://szparalab.psu.edu/</a>, or on Science Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SzparaLab">@SzparaLab</a>.
