    Dr. Lozupone is as Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Her research focuses on the complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. She has been heavily involved in the development of popular computational tools for microbial community analysis, such as the UniFrac algorithm for comparing microbial diversity among many samples using phylogenetic information. Dr. Lozupone currently runs an R01 funded research group that integrates integrative bioinformatics analysis of multi'omic data with experimental confirmation. Her lab is currently working to understand microbiome composition and function in a variety of disease contexts, with an emphasis on the interaction between the gut microbiome, local and systemic immune phenotypes, and metabolic and lung co-morbidity in HIV-infected individuals.

    Moriah Szpara is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Biology, and of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the Pennsylvania State University. Her group is part of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics (CIDD) at Penn State, within the Huck Institutes for the Life Sciences. Szpara received her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cell Biology from the University of California Berkeley, in neurobiology. As a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University with Dr. Lynn Enquist, Dr. Szpara focused on the neurotropic herpesviruses. The Szpara lab now explores the impacts of viral genetic diversity on virulence and disease severity, with a focus on viruses that infect the nervous system. This research spans the range from genomic and bioinformatic comparisons of viral genomes, to dissecting viral interactions with human neurons, to examining viral diversity in real-world human infections. We also build open-source tools for working with viral genomes, like VirAmp <a href="http://viramp.com">(http://viramp.com)</a> and VirGA <a href="http://virga.readthedocs.org/">(http://virga.readthedocs.org/)</a>.
