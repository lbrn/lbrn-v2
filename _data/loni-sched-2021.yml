    Dr. Lozupone is as Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Her research focuses on the complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. She has been heavily involved in the development of popular computational tools for microbial community analysis, such as the UniFrac algorithm for comparing microbial diversity among many samples using phylogenetic information. Dr. Lozupone currently runs an R01 funded research group that integrates integrative bioinformatics analysis of multi'omic data with experimental confirmation. Her lab is currently working to understand microbiome composition and function in a variety of disease contexts, with an emphasis on the interaction between the gut microbiome, local and systemic immune phenotypes, and metabolic and lung co-morbidity in HIV-infected individuals.
