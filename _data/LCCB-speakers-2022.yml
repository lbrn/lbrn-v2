      Dr. Sara Sawyer is a Professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. She has received national and international prizes in virology. In 2011 she was as awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) by President Barack Obama at the White House. She serves as a Senior Editor at the journal eLIFE, and as a government consultant on the topic of pandemic preparedness. In 2020, she co-founded Darwin Biosciences, an infectious disease diagnostics company located in Boulder, Colorado. Her research focuses on animal viruses that infect humans, including the emergent viruses HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

    Snyder Lab was the first to perform a large-scale functional genomics project in any organism, and has developed many technologies in genomics and proteomics. These including the development of proteome chips, high resolution tiling arrays for the entire human genome, methods for global mapping of transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-chip now replaced by ChIP-seq), paired end sequencing for mapping of structural variation in eukaryotes, de novo genome sequencing of genomes using high throughput technologies and RNA-Seq. These technologies have been used for characterizing genomes, proteomes and regulatory networks.

    Seminal findings from the Snyder laboratory include the discovery that much more of the human genome is transcribed and contains regulatory information than was previously appreciated, and a high diversity of transcription factor binding occurs both between and within species.

    He has also combined different state-of-the-art "omics" technologies to perform the first longitudinal detailed integrative personal omics profile (iPOP) of person and used this to assess disease risk and monitor disease states for personalized medicine. Dr. Snyder is the cofounder of Personalis, SensOmics, Qbio @qbioinc, January AI, Filtricine, Mirvie, Protos, Protometrix (now part of Thermo-Fisher). Affomix (now part of Illumina). Dr. Snyder presently serves on the board of a number of companies.Dr Snyder is the author of the book: 'Genomics and Personalized Medicine: What Everyone Needs to Know'.

  abstract: |
    Melissa Wilson is a computational biologist whose main research interests include sex-biased biology and how this affects human health and disease. Her lab primarily focuses on three main areas:   1) Atypical sex chromosome copy numbers occur with surprising frequency in humans (Turner Syndrome, individuals with a single X, occurs in 1/2500 live female births, and Klinefelter syndrome, XXY, occurs in 1/1000 males). The clinical consequences of sex chromosome copy variation is dramatically influenced by the evolutionary history of the human sex chromosomes. The Wilson lab is focusing on understanding the evolution of sex-linked gene content.  2) Sex as a Biological Variable. The Wilson lab studies how to more accurately quantify variation on the sex chromosomes and how to conduct sex-stratified analyses. This work is being applied to study variation in human cancers and in the placenta.    3) Patterns of variation on the sex chromosomes hold signatures of our evolutionary history as human beings, including sex-biased bottlenecks and selection that may leave some populations more vulnerable to specific diseases. The Wilson lab uses modeling and population genomics to understand human demographic history.
