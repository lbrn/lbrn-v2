<h2>About REDCap</h2>
<p>REDCap (REsearch Data Capture) is an application that allows users to build and manage online surveys and databases quickly and securely. LSU (LBRN) is a member of the consortium and hosts REDCap on LSU/LBRN servers. For REDCap documentation, videos, more information see: <a href="https://projectredcap.org">Project REDCap</a></p>
<h2>Using LBRN REDCap</h2>
<p>LBRN's partners and PUI campuses that don't already have access to REDCap can use LBRN's REDCap with permission. See the following application form to apply for access.</p>

LBRN PIs and Cores:
<p class="important"> Contact the LBRN computer manager directly.</p>
<br>
LSU Researchers:
<p class="important"> Please understand that for LBRN REDCap account assignments, only active LSU Baton Rouge campus faculty, permanent researchers, and postdoctoral fellows are considered eligible to serve as PIs. In exceptional cases, students will need a document from their supervisor.
The supporting documentation requires students, as advisors and project investigators, to be aware of their responsibilities for using certain features of REDCap through the application.
    <br>
Please be aware that the REDCap account is supported purely as a volunteer concept to help LSU researchs, so we cannot be held responsible for its use and the consequences of its use.
