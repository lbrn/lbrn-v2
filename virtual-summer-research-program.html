      <p>LBRN is pleased to make available our <b><a href="downloads/2022 LBRN Summer REU horizontal v4.pdf">2022 LBRN Summer Bioinformatics Training</a></b> for undergraduate, graduate students, faculty and staff from institutions across Louisiana. This program is in place of our regular summer program, which was cancelled due to COVID-19. This program will proceed in virtual/online formats with support from Pine BioTech.</p>

<p>Program begins on or after June 6th, 2022. Applications will be reviewed on a first come basis immediately after the deadline. All these courses are free to for undergraduate, graduate students, faculty and staff from institutions across Louisiana.</p>

<p>Optional live sessions once per week with an option to request a one on one meeting if needed in the programs. Other than that recorded sessions will be sent out to all of the participants with specific directions on how to complete online modules.</p>

<p>Please see the following listed programs available for all the program details from each participating LBRN Partner. You can also view the information on their website here: <a href="https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed">https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed</a></p>

<p><b><i>Owing to scheduling logistics "Omic Logic" is the only course that can be taken as a combination with one of the other * programs.</p></b></i>

     <li><b><a href="https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed">Omics Logic Basics.</a></b> This program is best suited for students interested to learn about various -omics technologies and how bioinformatics is used in biotechnology, healthcare, agriculture and basic research.  Program access provides access to all the asynchronous* online courses (basic course certificates only). This can be taken at the same time as ALL the other programs.</li>
     <br>
	*The below projects can be taken at the same time with Omics Logic Basics.     
<br><br>
     	<li><b><a href="https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed">*Biomedical Data Analysis in R & Python.</a></b> Getting Started with Bioinformatics in R and Python - As biology is saturated with complex datasets that have to be besorted, explored, and“looked into”, anyone handling data generation, analysis, or decision making based on data has to gain some level of “data science” skills. In most biological and biomedical settings, you will be expected to run or implement programs written by Python, R, and others. R programming offers a complete range of functionality that you can leverage to perform in-depth statistical analysis, visualization and annotation. The increasing necessity to process big data and develop algorithms in all fields of science means that programming is becoming an essential skill for scientists, with Python the language of choice for the majority of bioinformaticians.</li>
     <br>
	<li><b><a href="https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed">*Bioinformatics for Infectious Diseases.</a></b> This program is dedicated to the study of viral diversity and its role in epidemic infectious diseases that keep re-emerging, including zoonotic spillover, transmission between humans, and the process of viral and bacterial disease development. As a result, you will learn to understand relationships between viral strains and haplotypes, find differences in sequence data, and see the implications for drug and vaccine design. This program will provide opportunities to practice analyzing data to gain hands-on experience with curated datasets from public domain collections, guided by experts with bioinformatics experience and knowledge about virology.</li>
<br>
	<li><b><a href="https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed">*Transcriptomics for Chronic Diseases</a></b> An online training program focused on next-generation sequencing (NGS) Data Analysis in application to gene expression data with project examples from infectious diseases, cancer & neuroscience. This online program will introduce real-world applications of RNA-seq data analysis in biomedical research and provide participants with hands-on skills and logical background to extract insights from gene expression data. We will review the methods and history of quantitative and qualitative analysis of mRNA expression. Practical sessions will guide participants to use the methods we review on several project datasets to practice generating a table of expression from raw FASTq files and perform subsequent analysis of this table of gene and isoform expression.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><b><a href="https://edu.omicslogic.com/lsu-biommed">*Research Project</a></b> It has been designed to help young researchers and students take advantage of the bioinformatics resources for analysis of complex life science data and become versed in bioinformatics. Research Fellows participate in cutting-edge bioinformatics research led by expert mentors. The program will offer a combination of online resources and mentor guidance to prepare you and help you complete a bioinformatics project. We offer high-grade training and research tools for hands-on analysis for various research fields which includes analysis of Big Data belonging to Multi-Omics fields (Transcriptomics, Genomics, Epigenomics & Metagenomics), Infectious Diseases, Precision Medicine, Neuroscience, Space-Omics, Metabolic Disorders etc.
