      <p>LBRN is pleased to make available our <b><a href="downloads/2021 Virtual LBRN Summer REU Complete v2.pdf">2021 Virtual Summer Program Opportunities</a></b> for LBRN participants. This program is in place of our regular summer program, which was cancelled due to COVID-19. This program will proceed in various virtual/online formats with support from our LBRN PUI campuses and Pine BioTech.</p>

<p>Deadline for registration is June 16, 2021. Program begins June 21, 2021. Applications will be reviewed on a first come basis immediately after the deadline. All these courses are free to LBRN participants.</p>

<p>Please see the following listed programs available for all the program details from each participating LBRN Partner.</p>

<p><b><i>Owing to scheduling logistics "Omic Logic" is the only course that can be taken as a combination with one of the other * programs.</p></b></i>

        <h3>Pine Bio Omics Data Sense and More Programs</h3>
        <p><a href="downloads/Pine.Bio 2021 LBRN Virtual Summer Programs.pdf"><img src="images/postImages/Pine.Bio 2021 LBRN Virtual Summer Programs.png" alt="Pine.Bio 2021 LBRN Virtual Summer Program Information" style="float:right;width:300px;border:0;padding-left:20px;"></a>

     <ul>
     <li><b>Omics Logic Basics.</b> This program is best suited for students interested to learn about various -omics technologies and how bioinformatics is used in biotechnology, healthcare, agriculture and basic research.  Program access provides access to all the asynchronous* online courses (basic course certificates only). This can be taken at the same time as ALL the other programs. *This project can be taken at the same time with any other project listed for our virtual summer program.</li>
     
	<li><b>*Bioinformatics for Infectious Diseases.</b> This program is dedicated to the applications of bioinformatics to the study of pathogen genomics and host responses. We will explore genomic diversity of pathogens in epidemics, study viral zoonotic spillover, apply evolutionary analysis to understand adaptation and explore examples of viral and bacterial disease development. Participants will have the chance to learn about genomics and apply their understanding to public-domain data. As a result, every participant will learn a) to understand relationships between genomes, strains and haplotypes, b) to find differences in genomic sequences, c) to interpret the functional consequences of identified variants, and d) to study host responses connecting pathogen variation with disease and immunity. This program is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with curated datasets from the public domain as well as guidance and support of bioinformaticians with experience.
	</li>
	<li><b>*SARS-COV2: Genomic Data Analysis.</b> In this program, we will learn about the way the SARS-COV-2 pandemic has transformed our appreciation of genomics and bioinformatics. Participants will learn about genomic data analysis tools that can be used to identify specific viral strains, understand multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and the significance of mutations in the context of viral protein structure and function. We will further discuss the viral genome of SARS- CoV-2 (pathogen causing Covid-19) structure: genes, sub-genomic DNA fragments, proteins, and the virology of the disease. We will discuss how the data and the various analysis tools can help in the characterization of viral genomes, compare, and distinguish between viral strains, identify the impact of mutations on the functionality of viral proteins, and discuss the emerging challenges with the tracking of Variants of Concern (VOCs) reported in media.</li>
	
	<li><b>*Data Science for Biomedical Data</b> The rapid growth of high-throughput data, including -omics technologies, gave rise to significant demand for data science skills and experience with bioinformatics methods of analysis. This online training program is designed for beginners and students interested in data-driven research questions. The program will include aspects of data science, such as data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. The methods will be reviewed in the context of biomedical and other scientific problems.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>*Research Fellowship</b> The research fellowship program is designed to provide support and guidance on development of an independent research project within a given timeframe (3-6 months). During this time, participants meet on a weekly basis to share their progress and get feedback from the program coordinators. They can also request one-on-one sessions with a mentor on a weekly basis or meet in smaller focus groups. The program is structured around access to various training sessions, weekly progress updates and reviews or focused group meetings on topics of special interest with an expert mentor.
