		<p>We are very proud that in-spite of the unprecedented pandemic LBRN investigators and students have been carrying out active research in a responsible and safe manner. This is an open meeting and all are welcome, there is no registration fee. We invite the biomedical researchers from all over the state to participate.</p>

      	<p>Each year the LBRN program has an annual meeting in which program participants, committee members and administrators meet to review individual research accomplishments and to discuss the overall program activity. Summer research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to present their LBRN sponsored research, and talks are scheduled to highlight sponsored research projects from partnered campuses across the state.</p>

        <p>Oral Presenters: LBRN Translational Project PIs, INBRE COBRE Collaboration Project PIs, Supplemental Project PIs, Full Project PIs, LBRN Graduate Students, and invited guests.</p>
        <p>Poster Sessions: All projects currently funded by the LBRN, Summer Graduate students are required to submit an abstract to participate in the poster session. LBRN Undergraduate Summer students and all biomedical researchers within the state of Louisiana are invited to submit abstracts. Poster abstract submission form will be sent after your registration. </p>
