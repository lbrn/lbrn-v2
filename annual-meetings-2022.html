		<p>Greetings!!  LBRN team is pleased to announce that the 20th Annual LBRN Meeting will be held virtually on the 28th and 29th of January, 2022. The virtual format has been necessitated owing to COVID-19 related safety measures. As was the case last year, in-spite of the unprecedented pandemic LBRN investigators and students have been carrying out active research in a responsible and safe manner. We are encouraged by their commitment and look forward to celebrating the wonderful research efforts by all involved. This is an open meeting and all are welcome, there is no registration fee. We invite the biomedical researchers from all over the state to participate.</p>

      	<p>Each year the LBRN program has an annual meeting in which program participants, committee members and administrators meet to review individual research accomplishments and to discuss the overall program activity. Summer research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to present their LBRN sponsored research, and talks are scheduled to highlight sponsored research projects from partnered campuses across the state.</p>

        <p>Oral Presenters: Full Project PIs, INBRE / COBRE Collaboration Supplemental Project PIs, LBRN Maternal Health Supplemental Project PIs, LBRN Graduate Students (Flash talks), and invited guests.</p>
        
        <p>Poster Sessions: All projects currently funded by the LBRN and Summer Graduate students are required to submit an abstract to participate in the poster session. LBRN Undergraduate Summer students and all biomedical researchers within the state of Louisiana are also expected to submit abstracts. Poster abstract submission form will be sent after your registration.<p>
<p>To recognize the efforts, we will continue the tradition of awarding:
<ul>
	<li>1st and 2nd place award for Graduate and Undergraduate Posters, </li>
	<li>1st place award for Graduate Flash talks, </li>
	<li>1st and 2nd place awards for Project Posters and finally, </li>
	<li>1st place award for Oral Presentations by Full project PIs.</li>
</ul>
</p>
