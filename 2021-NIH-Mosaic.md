The [Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers (MOSAIC)](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/careerdev/Pages/MOSAIC.aspx) funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) have been reissued. MOSAIC, a trans-NIH initiative that NIGMS oversees, has two components: a postdoctoral career transition award (K99/R00), and a cohort-based mentoring and career development program that supports the scholars (UE5 research education cooperative agreement).

### MOSAIC Postdoctoral Career Transition Awards to Promote Diversity (K99/R00)

The MOSAIC K99/R00 program facilitates the timely transition of individuals from [diverse backgrounds](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html) from their mentored, postdoctoral research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions at research-intensive institutions. The program supports those who have demonstrated compelling commitments and contributions to enhancing diversity in the biomedical sciences, and includes three FOAs to accommodate the breadth of research conducted in the mission of participating institutes and centers (ICs):

[PAR-21-271](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-271.html) – Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed  
[PAR-21-272](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-272.html) – Independent Clinical Trial Required  
[PAR-21-273](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-273.html) -﻿ Independent Basic Experimental Studies with Humans Required  

It’s important that applicants reach out to the appropriate scientific/research contact prior to applying, since not all NIH ICs participate in these announcements (e.g., NIGMS participates only in PAR-21-271). Applications are accepted three times a year, and the next due date for new applications is **October 27, 2021**.

### MOSAIC Institutionally-Focused Research Education Cooperative Agreement to Promote Diversity (UE5)

UE5 awards are made to independent organizations (e.g., scientific societies) to support educational activities that equip [MOSAIC K99/R00](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/careerdev/Pages/mosaic-scholars.aspx) scholars with professional skills and provide them with the appropriate mentoring and professional networks to allow them to transition into, advance, and succeed in independent academic research careers at research-intensive institutions. NIH will specify areas of programmatic need for each receipt date, reflecting the disciplinary backgrounds of the MOSAIC K99/R00 scholars, through a [notice of special interest](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-21-051.html) to the MOSAIC UE5 announcement. Only applications aligned with these areas of need will be accepted for review. The areas of programmatic need for the upcoming receipt date are:

Neuroscience
Microbiology and immunology
Clinical and translational physiology and pathophysiology of multiple human organ systems
We encourage organizations interested in the UE5 funding opportunity [(PAR-21-277)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-277.html) to reach out to the NIH scientific/research contacts listed in the FOA to learn more about the suitability of your proposed application for the MOSAIC program and the funding priorities of participating NIH ICs. The next application due date is **November 18, 2021**.
