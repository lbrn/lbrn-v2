<p>The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) Bureau of Health Services Financing (Medicaid) is pleased to announce continuation of this funding opportunity for Louisiana public colleges and universities for State Fiscal Year 23. The Louisiana Public University Partnership Program (PUPP) involves cost sharing between the public college/university and LDH for research opportunities that will advance Louisiana Medicaid priorities. Research can consist of a new project or an expansion of existing efforts. Successful proposals will demonstrate how the findings of the project will promote delivery of evidence-based, high-quality, accessible, and cost-effective care to Louisiana Medicaid members.
