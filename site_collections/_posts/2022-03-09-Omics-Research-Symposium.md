We are glad to announce the upcoming symposium on March 31 & April 01, 2022, bringing together students, researchers, faculty, and industry to discuss recent advances in omics data and bioinformatics. Discussions will highlight challenges involved in research using computational tools for big data, opportunities in this outgrowing field, and applications of the advances in various fields - such as clinical, pharma & biotech, research, and agriculture. The symposium will be accompanied by a poster presentation session and competition, awarding prizes and giving a stage to students, faculty, and research teams to present their research work and get expert feedback.
