<p>Scientific computing is becoming more ubiquitous for all types of research areas. Skills and knowledge that are necessary to take full advantage of the power of computing, however, are often inadequately present in both curricular and extracurricular training. The purpose of this workshop is, by both presentation and hands-on experiences, to help attendants understand the usage of popular scientific computing programming tools and prepare for their future computational study and research career.
