Each year the LBRN program has an annual meeting in which program participants, committee members and administrators meet to review individual research accomplishments and to discuss the overall program activity. Summer research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to present their LBRN sponsored research, and talks are scheduled to highlight sponsored research projects from partnered campuses across the state.

The 23rd LBRN Annual Meeting will be held virtually on Thursday and Friday, February 20-21. Details and registration information will be posted on the LBRN webpage later on.
