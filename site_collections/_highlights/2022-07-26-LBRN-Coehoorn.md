Caleb Charpentier from Southeastern Louisiana University was recently awarded a Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation to pursue a Ph.D at Virginia Tech starting in the Fall. Only two of these prestigious fellowships were awarded to students from Louisiana last year. Caleb had worked with Dr. April Wright for 5 semesters under an LBRN grant. He is also the first author on a recently published article in  the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution, entitled ["Revticulate: An R framework for interaction with RevBayes."][1]

Through his work as a researcher in a computational phylogenetics lab, he has learned to program in three languages and has made a software called RevR that will be very useful to scientists doing phylogenetics research. After graduation he plans to do research as a Ph.D. student.
