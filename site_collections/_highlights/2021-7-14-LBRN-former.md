MY SUCCESS STORY AND THE IMPACT OF LBRN

As the first girl child in my family with an advanced degree, I have always dreamed of excelling and being a role model for others who have all the potentials but see no hope. While I have always been clear in my goals, I was not sure how to actualize them. However, what keeps me going is the conviction and belief that the sky is the starting point with persistence and determination.

Among many others, one of the goals I set for myself was to study in one of the top global public health schools. To improve my chances, it was clear that I needed to stand out in both academic prowess and research to realize my dream. Thus, I devoted myself to my classes and academic work.

Also, to increase my chances of success, I sought research exposure opportunities as it was clear that excellent academic performance is not sufficient. Fortunately, a research experience opportunity through Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) came at the right time. A significant landmark in my career progression was the research experience I garnered with LBRN, which exposed me to research on the Fabrication of Human-Scale Biliary Trees Surgical Replacements through 3D Printing. While working on this research, we explored the high complexity of liver transplant surgical procedure, which requires delicate harvesting of the donor and implanting same in the recipient.  While there has been a significant rise in the number of global transplantations performed (8000 liver transplants performed in the United States as of 2017), one of the essential reasons for post-liver transplant failure and mortality is related biliary tree complications. We were able to demonstrate invitro proof of design concept combination of 3D printed plastic biliary stents infused with Cholangiocytes.

The catalog of experiences and excellent research skills I gathered within a short period was remarkable, and tremendously improved the quality of my application to John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. LBRN will forever have a special place in my heart. - Adeola Adedokun
