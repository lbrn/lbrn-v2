Student, staff and faculty participants from universities across the state gathered at LSU Shreveport on October 20, 2022, for the [2022 Biomedical Research and Industry Day (BRAID)][1].  BRAID was hosted by a partnership between the Center for Cardiovascular Diseases and Sciences (CCDS), Center for Brain Health (CBH), and Louisiana Addiction Research Center (LARC), at LSU Health Shreveport, and Louisiana State University Shreveport (LSUS), in collaboration with University of Louisiana Monroe and the Innovation Enterprise at Louisiana Tech University.
 
Several of LSUS’ LBRN members presented their work. Dr. Cory Coehoorn presented an oral talk on “Rapid heat stress and firefighters: the Problem and Solution,” while LSUS students and faculty presented seven of the sixty posters:

Sara-Alexis Jarecki: Large-scale Production of Central Precursors for Anticancer Alkaloids in Microbial System (Mentor: Dr. Vonny Salim)  
Audrey Lashley: Structural Determinants for Substrate Specificity in Anticancer Alkaloid Methyltransferase (Mentor: Dr. Vonny Salim)  
Michael Minamyer: Subcellular Localization of Enzymes for Anticancer Alkaloid Synthesis in Recombinant System (Mentor: Dr. Vonny Salim)
