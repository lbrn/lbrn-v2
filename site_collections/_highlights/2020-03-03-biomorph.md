Louisiana Tech’s BioMorph Lab, directed by professor <b>Dr. David Mills (LBRN PI)</b>, recently received a pair of research contracts from the U.S. Air Force that call for the development of an antimicrobial filament for 3D medical device printing and a multifunctional bandage.

The antimicrobial filament is a bioplastic that contains agents to kill bacteria, fungi, and other elements that cause infection. The bandage will be multifunctional because it can be used in combat, at a military hospital, or for civilians. Components of the bandage will be printed.

This is the first time the BioMorph Lab has received a USAF grant, but the Lab has had Department of Defense funding in the past. The contract is classified as Phase I, which is for 90 days. Mills’ major goal is to locate a military medical partner for his Phase II proposal. Specifically, the research contracts are a collaboration between the USAF, Tech’s BioMorph lab, and Mills’ two startups, organicNANA and Nano Medicine.
