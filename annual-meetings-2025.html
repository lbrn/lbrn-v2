		<p>We are very proud that in-spite of the unprecedented pandemic LBRN investigators and students have been carrying out active research in a responsible and safe manner. This is an open meeting and all are welcome, there is no registration fee. We invite the biomedical researchers from all over the state to participate.</p>
