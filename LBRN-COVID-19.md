As of February 11, 2021 from Louisiana's Governer's statement: "Gov. John Bel Edwards on Wednesday signed a proclamation extending Louisiana’s modified Phase 2 guidelines, which include sensible restrictions meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 like a statewide mask mandate, for another 21 days. The new order is set to expire on March 3, 2021."<!--more-->

"Hospitalizations and test positivity have improved in Louisiana, but cases are still very high and more people are in the hospital today than were last summer. January was the second deadliest month of the pandemic in Louisiana and, with Mardi Gras next week, Louisiana cannot afford to relax restrictions. Last year, before public health officials were warning against cancelling large events, COVID-19 was spread during Mardi Gras celebrations, leading to many cases and deaths in the New Orleans region."

“Our conduct should not change in the foreseeable future,” Gov. Edwards said. “Please, be very smart and very courteous about how you act and please wear your mask, distance, wash your hands frequently, stay home when you are sick, protect the vulnerable and, when you are able to do so, get vaccinated," Gov. Edwards said. 

The Governor’s new order expires on March 3, 2021
