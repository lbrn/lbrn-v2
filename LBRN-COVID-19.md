December 21, 2021: Gov. John Bel Edwards today extended Louisiana’s Public Health Emergency order related to COVID-19, including a provision allowing all state government agencies to require mask wearing, given the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which is now the dominant strain in the United States and Louisiana according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State agencies in the Governor’s Cabinet will begin requiring masks of employees and visitors. See Governer's statement for more information: <!--more-->

LBRN is based at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge with administrative staff at LSU School of Veterinary Medicine and the LSU Center for Computation & Technology. We shifted to working remotely on March 17th, 2020 and continue to handle the day to day activities of the grant - some of us have returned to the office as needed since then. Any announcements regarding our activities will come out as needed. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to drop us a note at [LBRN E-mail](mailto:lbrn@lsu.edu) if you are not already in touch with us directly.
